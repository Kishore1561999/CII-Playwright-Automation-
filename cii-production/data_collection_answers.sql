Identifying potential hazards and risks associated with specific activities, processes, or environments through Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA); \\n2. Evaluating likelihood and potential consequences of these risks; \\n3. Prioritizing risks based on their significance and potential impact on safety, health, and the environment; \\n4. Developing strategies to control, reduce, or eliminate significant risks through engineering controls, administrative controls, and/or personal protective equipment (PPE); \\n5. Periodically reviewing and reassessing risks to ensure ongoing effectiveness of risk management measures. \\n\\nAt the Bank’s large offices, some key activities include maintaining inventory of materials and material safety data sheets (MSDSs), periodic testing of premises for air, noise and illumination quality, an online system for recording safety related complaints from employees, and log of maintenance of the premises. Further, there is ongoing evaluation of business centres and other premises for structural damages, and its relocation if required. Dedicated persons have been appointed for oversight on all work-related issues at the Bank’s premises, for addressing concerns as well as maintaining reports and data on health and safety related matters.\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes", "pb_20_textarea": "", "pb_21_textarea": "", "pb_22_textarea": "", "pb_23_textarea": "", "pb_24_textarea": "", "pb_25_textarea": "", "pb_26_textarea": "Yes",

For both our carbon and cement business we are implementing additional improvements to our safety management systems, based on recommendations by the National Safety Council, British safety council and other third-party auditors such as Chola MS to improve the effectiveness of our existing safety systems and procedures. We are also implementing KAIZEN framework at our carbon units and quality circle initiatives in cement units. Both of our cement plants (Rain Cements Ltd.) and three of our European sites (Rain Carbon Inc.) hold the ISO 45001 certification.  Recently we have appointed a Group Chief Medical Officer at our corporate office, in order to strengthen the medical and wellness campaign throughout the organization. Additionally, we recently conducted a few medical camps in our cement units, and we have also tied up with Apollo health clinic for annual medical check up of our employees at Carbon units.\\n\\nOur focus includes our Life-Saving Rules campaign, site audits, leadership walkthroughs, and near misses and unsafe conditions/unsafe acts program and the need for increased safety related communication at all levels of our organization. We also emphasize training to raise awareness about routine and non-routine hazards during, daily working conditions, process changes, project construction and start-ups, and planned shutdowns for repairs and maintenance. We regularly conduct toolbox talks, as part of our safety procedures and before taking up of any new assignments in order to orient safety requirements for the job and precautions to be taken during the course of the said job.\\n\\nWe continuously strive for better safety work standards and to ensure zero incidents. Hence, we continuously work upon areas of improvement in order to have a safer workplace. These areas for improvement are a top priority throughout RAIN and they enables us to make important progress on our ‘Quest for Zero’ journey.\\n\\nThe Board of Directors evaluates the framework, focusing on discussions regarding management submissions on risks, identifying crucial risks and approving relevant action plans to mitigate such risks based on priority. The responsibility of assisting the Risk Management Committee on an independent basis lies with the internal audit function armed with the complete status of risk assessments and management.

The Company has\\nset measurable objectives and targets for safety performance and it continuously monitors key\\nperformance indicators like safety engagement, occupational Injury frequency rate, safety audit\\nscore, near misses.\\n• Culture of Safety: The Company implemented behaviour-based safety programs that\\nencouraged safe work practices and risk identification. It provided regular training to all\\nemployees (including contract workers) on hazard awareness, safe work procedures, and\\nemergency response protocols. The Company fosters open communication and encourages\\nemployees to report safety concerns without fear of reprisal and conducts focus activities like\\nWorld Environment Day etc.\\n\\nAt Emami, we believe in a proactive approach to hazard identification which is the bedrock of our\\ncommitment to “Zero” harm. A detailed HIRA is carried out for all processes at our plant. All non\\nstandard operations are carried out under a “Work permit” issued after a thorough risk assessment.\\nWe encourage all employees and visitors to report a hazard wherever it comes to their attention. This\\nyear we have developed a digitized Hazard Identification Tracking System for all our manufacturing\\nunits. This system consists of QR codes placed in each zone of the factory. If someone identifies\\nany hazard, they can scan the QR code, fill out the form, and submit it. Thereafter the tech enabled\\nsystem ensures the risk is assessed and corrective action implemented.\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes", "pb_20_textarea": "", "pb_21_textarea": "", "pb_22_textarea": "",

There is documentation of health risks on a regular basis following a bottom up approach and at the strategic level a top down approach where in evaluation of progress in reducing/preventing health issues/risks is monitored through internal inspections, consultations by OHS specialists as well as independent external verification of health, safety and wellbeing such as OHSAS 18000. The Bank developed effective Health & Safety Management System which integrates safety in day-to-day operations and allows an organisation to consistently identify and control its safety risks, reduce the potential for accidents, help achieve compliance with safety legislations and continually improve its performance. \\n\\nIt has provided a systematic way to identify workplace hazards and risks and to setup a continual safety improvement programme to implement suitable controls to manage risks. The Bank is committed to providing its employees a safe and secure working environment. A Health and Safety Management System helps achieve compliance with safety legislations and the implementation of suitable controls to manage risks against identified workplace hazards. The Bank has a Fire Safety Manual, Security Manual, Facilities and Administration Manual and Workplace Health and Safety Policy in place. Regular drills and trainings in first aid, fire safety and personal safety are conducted together with periodic checks on the physical and mental health of employees. During FY 2023-2024: Fire safety training and evacuation drills were conducted at 42 high-rise buildings and 100% of the bank’s branches across all zones. Further, 100% of employees including outsourced staff participated in these fire and evacuation drills /training programmes. Online e-learning modules covering emergency preparedness at ground level have been implemented for further raising the awareness threshold of the environment in this regard. The efficacy of the fire drills and practices carried out is evident from non-occurrence of any major fire incidents since 2014.\\n\\nGiven the nature of business, this is not directly applicable. However, in light of the pandemic, the Bank recognises the risks of infections that could take place in the office premises. To minimise these risks, the Bank took necessary precautions at the offices, which included sanitisation of all office premises, removal of biometric scanners, installation of thermal scanners, daily communication updates, restricted movements in common areas, closure of recreational facilities and avoidance of large gatherings. The Bank also adhered to all the government directives and issued travel and health advisories to its employees and advised all its employees to work from home as required or on a rotational basis to

Here's a breakdown of the processes involved: \\nUnified Risk Assessment Process: This process is deployed across all work locations. It involves systematically identifying potential work-related hazards involved in activities. These hazards are then mapped to each routine activity, and the associated risks are evaluated and categorized as High, Medium, Low, or Significant. This information is digitized for easy access and reference. \\nAssessment of Non-Routine Activities: Hazards associated with non-routine activities are assessed during the activity planning stage. This assessment is a collaborative effort between the operations team and the Health & Safety team. Weekly reviews are conducted to ensure that potential hazards are identified and addressed effectively. \\nJob Safety Analysis (JSA) and Permit to Work System: For all non-routine activities, a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is conducted, and a permit-to-work system is adhered to before commencement of work. These processes ensure that potential risks are identified, and necessary precautions are taken to mitigate them. \\nHierarchy of Risk Control Measures: The entity adopts a hierarchy of risk control measures to determine the most effective ways to mitigate identified risks. This includes conducting Job Safety Analysis (JSA) and Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) to identify and mitigate potential risks.\\nImplementation of Control Measures: Once the risk control measures are determined, the Operation Control Procedures are developed and they are implemented to mitigate identified risks effectively. Regular safety talks and Health & Safety (H&S) time-outs are provided to workers to communicate available control measures and ensure that all safety protocols are being followed. \\nBy employing these processes, TCPL ensures a comprehensive approach to identifying work-related hazards, assessing risks, and implementing control measures to promote a safe working environment for its employees\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes", "pb_20_textarea": "", "pb_21_textarea": "", "pb_22_textarea": "", "pb_23_textarea": "\\"All employees and workers, regardless of their employment status (whether permanent or non-permanent), receive\\ncompensation that meets or exceeds the minimum wage requirements as mandated by the laws of the country.\\" However, retained the response as reported in XBRL.", "pb_24_textarea": "", "pb_25_textarea": "", "pb_26_textarea": "We have integrated a Human Rights clause into all our supplier agreements to address critical issues such as forced labor,\\nchild labor, discrimination, working hours, wages, and disciplinary actions.

By attaining this certification, we aim to attain leadership commitment, worker participation, hazard identification, risk assessment, legal compliance, emergency planning, incident investigation, and continual improvement.\\n\\nBCML employs a comprehensive approach to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on both routine and non-routine bases. This includes regular workplace inspections to identify hazards and ensure safety compliance. Incident reports and near-miss events are analyzed to prevent future occurrences. Routine hazard identification and risk assessment exercises are conducted to proactively mitigate risks. Job safety analysis techniques are used to evaluate the safety of specific tasks, identifying and mitigating hazards at each step. Regular consultations with employees and safety committees gather insights and develop effective risk mitigation strategies.\\n\\nAdditionally, BCML continuously monitors and evaluates changes in work processes or conditions to identify new hazards or risks, ensuring that safety measures are updated and adapted to the evolving work environment. This integrated approach ensures a thorough and dynamic method of maintaining workplace safety.\\n\\nYes\\n\\nYes", "pb_20_textarea": "SGS India Private Limited, an external agency has carried out

The manual also clearly defines the scope and responsibilities of the teams tasked with overseeing the OHSMS. A monitoring plan takes into account factors including parameters measured, locations, scope and the methods used. The senior management is responsible for overseeing the evaluation of OHS performance and determining its effectiveness. Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) exercise as per the requirements of ISO 45001:2018 standard is conducted, where all the work-related hazards are identified and risks on a routine and non-routine basis are assessed, and their mitigation/preventive measures tabulated. The non-routine jobs are maintenance activities and extension of the premises etc. HIRA is reviewed annually or in light of any incident and revised accordingly if required. The updated HIRA is then circulated to all the relevant premises to ensure that the knowledge gathered is circulated and used by all.\\nAt the ISO 45001:2018 certified premises, we adopted a process that includes, but is not limited to, how the work is organised, social factors, leadership and organisational culture, activities and situations, past relevant incidents, potential emergency situations, actual and proposed changes irrespective of the level and nature and changes in knowledge of and information about hazards. The Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) Management Representative (HMR) ensures that hazard identification is conducted by persons with competence in relevant hazard identification methodologies and techniques and appropriate knowledge of the work activity. All jobs performed at our premises are supervised by the HMR. They ensure proper work permits are requested and granted prior to the job being undertaken, and also note and report work\\nrelated hazards, if any. ‘Toolbox talks’ for routine and non-routine jobs are delivered to vendors undertaking work at our premises, as required which cover safety instructions and detailed processes to be followed to protect themselves from injuries or ill health and an OHSMS Hazard Identification Checklist is maintained. The methodology and criteria for the assessment of Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) risks are defined with respect to their scope, nature and timing to ensure they are proactive rather than reactive and are used in a systematic way. Employees are also encouraged to report any hazardous situations by either calling a designated helpline or writing to a location specifi helpdesk to enable timely and appropriate

The Company uses training and awareness initiatives, safety audits, and frequent safety committee meetings to keep an eye on performance, best practices, and issues connected to environmental health and safety.\\n\\nTo document occurrences, CEAT offers a number of platforms, including a mobile app, toolbox talk, safety meetings, daily work management meetings, and redbooks. Reporting on occurrences is recommended for employees. Supervisors and safety officials take the necessary steps to reduce and prevent similar incidents in the future, taking into account the type and frequency of the incident. All factories receive records and communications regarding problems that have been reported and investigated, which facilitate the horizontal deployment of remedial actions.\\nCEAT regularly performs occupational health and safety inspections as well as job safety analysis to measure risk. Hazards associated with work are quantified by evaluations of activity-based hazards; among the most significant risks are those connected to the control of health-harmful substances, manual material handling, equipment danger, display screen equipment, fire, and transportation.\\nIn order to evaluate risks both regularly and irregularly, the Company also uses work permits to undertake ergonomic assessments and task hazard analysis. To reduce the risks, the Company evaluates the performance and state of the current control systems. The top 15 hazards are recognized as significant risks with an efficient risk management plan using the risk-control matrix. A hierarchy of controls has been taken into consideration when creating the company's risk mitigation plan. Thus, engineering controls and their replacement or deletion are given top attention. The leadership evaluates the most important risks first, then engineering, the plant manager, the heads of the procurement, manufacturing, quality, and human resources departments, and finally the head of the plant.\\nThe company's Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (\\"HIRA\\") includes the following tasks: task hazard analysis through work permits; activity risk assessment; COSHH assessment; manual material handling assessment; DSE assessment; fire risk assessment; traffic risk assessment; and ergonomic assessment.\\nAt both the corporate and factory levels, the Company periodically analyses its safety dashboard. Internal auditors analyse the health and safety management system twice a year as part of the safety evaluation process. In order to do impartial third-party evaluations at each of the manufacturing plants, the Company also hires safety specialists and health and safety organizations.

Those\\nfalling into the “Unacceptable” and “Needs correction” categories, with LXS values ranging between 5 and 25, are considered significant and prioritized for action.\\n\\n2. Post-Control Evaluation of Hazards/Risks:\\n\\nControl Measure Implementation: The effectiveness of control measures implemented to mitigate identified\\nenvironmental aspects and impacts is a crucial component of the evaluation.\\n\\nOHS Hazards and Associated Risks Evaluation: Similar to environmental evaluations, OHS hazards and\\nassociated risks are assessed using overriding factors and the significance score criteria.\\n\\nCategorization of Significance Scores: The significance scores are categorized into three levels: High, Medium,\\nand Low. This categorization is based on a predefined evaluation table that guides the prioritization of hazard\\nmanagement efforts.\\n\\nBy adhering to this thorough evaluation process, the entity ensures that significant hazards and risks are identified and managed effectively.

The policy is designed to both prevent and detect any instances of bribery, corruption, or unethical behavior, ensuring that TEIL's business operations are conducted with the highest levels of honesty and integrity.\\nTo ensure that these ethical standards are ingrained throughout the organization, TEIL actively engages in promoting these practices. This is achieved through comprehensive training programs, detailed guidance, and continuous awareness campaigns that are tailored not just for employees but also for third-party partners. These initiatives are crucial in cultivating a deep-rooted ethical awareness and understanding that supports the policy's objectives.\\nMoreover, the effectiveness of the anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy are safeguarded through periodic reviews of the policy.

Once hazards are identified, the risk associated with each hazard is assessed to determine the likelihood and potential consequences of an incident occurring. Corrective actions are planned and implemented accordingly. \\n\\n•\\tHealth and Safety Inspections: this involves a comprehensive review of the organization’s policies, procedures, and practices related to health, safety, and environmental management. The objective of an HSE inspection and audit is to identify areas where improvements can be made to minimize the risk of incidents or accidents.
